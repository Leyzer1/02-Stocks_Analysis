# Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this challange we are asked to analyze stocks data for a given 2017 and 2018 dataset. We are asked to create a code that will ask the user to enter the the year of the data the he or she wants to analyze. The code will then return three columns: the tickers (stock abbreviations), the total daily volume and the returns. The last column is color formatted to clearly show negative and positive returns. Using the code we can easily compare both years results.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to demostrate the ability use arrays, to create For loops, to assign variable values, to know how to format ranges and cells. This code also will demostrate how the timer function is used. The timer function determine how fast the code will run, which helps the anaylist detrmine how effective their code is. Lastly this challege also demostrate the ability to neatly organize code by adding indentations and writting comments where necessary as this helps and the reader and the analysist clearer see what each line of code does. 

## Results
Creating the VBA code for this challege gave us the analysis for the data that the user inputs. For 2017 we can clearly see that all but one, "TERP", stocks had positive returns.  The top three stocks with the highest percentage of returns were: "DQ" with 199.4%, "SEDG" with 184%, and "ENPH" with 129.5% retunrs. In the other hand, 2018 had mostly negative returns with only "ENPH" and "RUN" having positive returns. The top three stocks with the highest negative returns were: "DQ" with -62.6%, "JKS with -60.5%, and "SPWR" with -44.6%. Lastly, refractoring the code greatly improved the speed in which the code runs.

### Summary
In summary, creating VBA code to anylyze large data sets can be very effective if the anylyzing process becomes a repetive task. VBA code can be reused over and over as long as the parameter of the data do not change. Refractoring code in general is good practice. Code can be use in a variaty of ways and and can be reused, this is what is called design patterns. Design patterns can be modified to accomodate to the code you want to build. The disavantages can be that using other people code can be challenging to understand if the prson did not properly format the code of there are no comments to help the reader understand what each line does. But the advantages largely outweight to cons, as refractoring code can take parts of a larger code and improce its effectivenes.
