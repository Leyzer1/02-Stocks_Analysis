# Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this challenge we are asked to analyze stocks data for a given 2017 and 2018 dataset. We are asked to create a code that will ask the user to enter the year of the data the he or she wants to analyze. The code will then return three columns: the tickers (stock abbreviations), the total daily volume and the returns. The last column is color formatted to clearly show negative and positive returns. Using the code, we can easily compare both years results.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the ability use arrays, to create For loops, to assign variable values, to know how to format ranges and cells. This code also will demonstrate how the timer function is used. The timer function determines how fast the code will run, which helps the analyst determine how effective their code is. Lastly this challenge also demonstrates the ability to neatly organize code by adding indentations and writing comments where necessary as this helps and the reader and the analysist clearer see what each line of code does. 

## Results
Creating the VBA code for this challenge gave us the analysis for the data that the user inputs. For 2017 we can clearly see that all but one, "TERP", stocks had positive returns.  The top three stocks with the highest percentage of returns were: "DQ" with 199.4%, "SEDG" with 184%, and "ENPH" with 129.5% returns. In the other hand, 2018 had mostly negative returns with only "ENPH" and "RUN" having positive returns. The top three stocks with the highest negative returns were: "DQ" with -62.6%, "JKS with -60.5%, and "SPWR" with -44.6%.

### Summary
In summary, creating VBA code to analyze large data sets can be very effective if the analyzing process becomes a respective task. VBA code can be reused over and over if the parameter of the data does not change. Refactoring code in general is good practice. Code can be use in a variety of ways and can be reused, this is what is called design patterns. Design patterns can be modified to accommodate to the code you want to build. The disadvantages can be that using other people code can be challenging to understand if the person did not properly format the code of there are no comments to help the reader understand what each line does. But the advantages largely outweigh to cons, as refactoring code can take parts of a larger code and improve its effectiveness.
